# Introduction to MCI

The **Model Context Interface (MCI)** is an open-source, platform-agnostic system that revolutionizes how you create and share AI agent tools. By leveraging simple JSON schemas, MCI enables developers to define collections of tools that work universally across programming languages and platforms.

## What is MCI?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Universal Tool Definition" icon="globe">
  Define AI tools using standardized JSON schemas that work in **every programming language** - Python, Node.js, Go, PHP, and beyond.
</Card>

<Card title="Multiple Execution Types" icon="code">
  Support for **HTTP**, **CLI**, **File**, and **Text** operations, allowing you
  to wrap REST APIs, command-line tools, file operations, and templates.
</Card>

<Card title="Built-in Authentication" icon="key">
  Comprehensive authentication support including **API Keys**, **Bearer
  Tokens**, **Basic Auth**, and **OAuth2** - all configured declaratively.
</Card>

<Card title="Advanced Templating" icon="wrench">
  Powerful template engine with environment variables, conditional logic (`@if`), and iteration (`@foreach`) for dynamic tool execution.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  MCI transforms complex AI tool development into simple JSON configuration.
  Your entire toolset fits in a single file that's easy to review, share, and
  maintain.
</Info>

## Why Use MCI?

### üöÄ **Simplicity Over Complexity**

Unlike complex server-based solutions, MCI tools are **declarative JSON files** that live directly in your project repository. No servers to maintain, no complex deployments - just clean, readable schemas.

<CodeGroup>
```json Simple Tool Definition
{
  "name": "greet_user",
  "description": "Generate a personalized greeting",
  "inputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "username": { "type": "string" }
    }
  },
  "execution": {
    "type": "text",
    "text": "Hello, {{props.username}}! Welcome to MCI."
  }
}
```

```python Instant Usage
from mcipy import MCIClient

client = MCIClient(json_file_path="tools.mci.json")
result = client.execute("greet_user", {"username": "Alice"})
# Output: "Hello, Alice! Welcome to MCI."
```

</CodeGroup>

### üîí **Secure by Design**

Your entire toolset is **transparent and auditable**. Every tool is defined in plain JSON that humans and AI can easily review. No black-box servers, no mysterious third-party code accessing your data.

### üåç **Universal Compatibility**

Write once, run everywhere. MCI works with any programming language because it uses operations available in **every programming language** - HTTP requests, CLI commands, file operations, and text processing.

### üì¶ **Maximum Flexibility**

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Project-Wide Tools">
One `.mci.json` file containing all tools for your entire project.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Agent-Specific Tools">
  Separate files per AI agent, each with their specialized toolset.
</Tab>

<Tab title="API Wrappers">
  One file per external API you want to wrap and use.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Mixed Sources">
Combine tools from different authors - it's not 10 servers to initialize, just 10 files in your repo.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## How MCI Differs from MCP

<Warning>
  MCI is designed as a **supplement to MCP**, not a replacement. Each serves
  different use cases in the AI tooling ecosystem.
</Warning>

| Aspect             | **MCI**                        | **MCP**                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Complexity**     | Simple JSON files              | Full server implementations        |
| **Use Case**       | API/CLI wrappers, simple tools | Complex logic, stateful operations |
| **Languages**      | Universal (JSON-based)         | Language-specific servers          |
| **Sharing**        | A few files                    | Whole project                      |
| **Review**         | Easy JSON audit                | Full codebase review               |
| **Infrastructure** | None required                  | Server infrastructure              |

### When to Choose MCI

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="üéØ Perfect for MCI">
- **API Wrappers**: Wrapping REST APIs with authentication
- **CLI Tool Integration**: Executing command-line tools
- **Simple Workflows**: File operations and text templating
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quick tool development and iteration
- **Easy Sharing**: Tools that need to be shared across teams
- **Security-Conscious**: Environments requiring full auditability
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="‚ö° Better with MCP">
- **Complex Logic**: Tools requiring sophisticated business logic
- **Stateful Operations**: Tools that maintain state across calls
- **Real-time Features**: Streaming or real-time data processing
- **Custom Protocols**: Non-standard communication requirements

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip**: Many teams use both! Start with MCI for quick API wrappers and
  simple tools, then graduate to MCP when you need complex server-side logic.
</Tip>

## Quick Start Example

See MCI in action with this complete example:

<Steps>
<Step title="Create Your Schema">
```json weather-tools.mci.json
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "get_weather",
      "description": "Get current weather for a city",
      "inputSchema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "city": { "type": "string" }
        },
        "required": ["city"]
      },
      "execution": {
        "type": "http",
        "method": "GET",
        "url": "https://api.weather.com/current?q={{props.city}}",
        "auth": {
          "type": "apiKey",
          "in": "header",
          "name": "X-API-Key",
          "value": "{{env.WEATHER_API_KEY}}"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
</Step>

<Step title="Use in Python">
```python
from mcipy import MCIClient

client = MCIClient(
json_file_path="weather-tools.mci.json",
env_vars={"WEATHER_API_KEY": "your-key"}
)

weather = client.execute("get_weather", {"city": "London"})
print(weather)

````
</Step>

<Step title="Share Everywhere">
Copy `weather-tools.mci.json` to any project, any language. It just works!
</Step>
</Steps>
