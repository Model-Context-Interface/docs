# Build Powerful AI Tools with Simple JSON Schemas

**Model Context Interface (MCI)** transforms how you create AI agent tools.

Define collections of tools in a single JSON file, execute them anywhere, and share them effortlessly.

No complex servers, no vendor lock-in ‚Äì just pure simplicity.

<Info>
  MCI makes AI tool development accessible to everyone by using JSON schemas
  that work in **every programming language**. It's a lightweight alternative to
  complex systems like MCP, living right in your project repo.
</Info>

## The Vision: Simplifying AI Development

MCP is a great tool that allows to create servers and tools with complex logic,
but in practice, it turned out that a lot of MCP servers are just API or CLI tool wrappers.
And prompts? Have you ever used "prompts" feature of MCP? And it is the entire server in your infrastructure.

So, sometimes MCP can be quite an overhead. **MCI changes everything** by bringing the simplicity and universality of JSON to AI tool development, acting more like a supplement to MCP than alternative.

You know, HTTP request, terminal command & reading file are basic features that every programming language supports. And sometimes (pretty often), it is what the AI needs as a tool, but framed, described, standardized, reusable, shareable and secure. That's what the MCI is!

### How MCI Makes AI Development Better

<Steps>
<Step title="Universal Standard">
  **One Schema, Every Language**
  
  JSON works everywhere. Your MCI tools work in Python today, Node.js tomorrow, and any future language your team adopts. No rewrites, no vendor lock-in.
</Step>

<Step title="Instant Shareability">
  Share your entire AI toolset by copying a single JSON file. Teams can
  collaborate on tools like they collaborate on code ‚Äì with version control,
  reviews, and easy distribution.
</Step>

<Step title="LLM-Friendly Design">
  The simple JSON format means LLMs can help you build tools. For example, Share
  API documentation with an AI, and it can generate whole MCI schema in minutes
  ‚Äì not hours or days.
</Step>

<Step title="Maximum Flexibility">
  One `.mci.json` file for your whole project, separate files per agent, one
  file per API, or mix tools from different authors. It doesn't matter ‚Äì it's
  not 10 servers to initialize, it's just 10 files in your repo.
</Step>

<Step title="Security & Trust">
  **Transparent & Auditable**
  
  Every tool is defined in plain JSON that humans and AI can easily review. No hidden server code, no mysterious third-party services ‚Äì just transparent, auditable tool definitions.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Quick Example

See how simple it is to create and use AI tools with MCI:

<CodeGroup>
```json tool-definition.mci.json
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "greet_user",
      "description": "Generate a personalized greeting message",
      "inputSchema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "username": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "user's name"
          }
        },
        "required": ["username"]
      },
      "execution": {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Hello, {{props.username}}! Welcome to MCI."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

```python Python Usage
from mcipy import MCIClient

# Initialize with your schema
client = MCIClient(json_file_path="tool-definition.mci.json")

# Execute the tool
result = client.execute(
    tool_name="greet_user",
    properties={"username": "Alice"}
)

print(result)  # "Hello Alice! Welcome to MCI."
```

</CodeGroup>

<Check>
  **That's it!** You've just defined and executed your first MCI tool. Scale
  this to hundreds of tools across your entire AI application.
